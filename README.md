Project Name: SDC310L Supplement Store (PHP Web Application)
Project Description

The Supplement Store is a PHP/MySQL web application that allows users to browse a catalog of supplements and manage a shopping cart. The project was developed over multiple weeks, starting with database design, then adding full CRUD support, and finally refactoring the application into an MVC architecture.

Project Tasks

Task 1: Review project requirements

Reviewed the course project overview and identified required features and data needs.

Task 2: Design and create the database

Designed the database schema for products and cart items.

Built the database and tables using phpMyAdmin and SQL scripts.

Task 3: Build the application framework

Created the folder/file structure and shared includes (config, db connection, layout).

Task 4: Add database support (CRUD)

Implemented product retrieval (SELECT) for the catalog.

Implemented cart actions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) using prepared statements.

Added pricing calculations (subtotal, tax, totals).

Task 5: Apply MVC architecture

Created Models to handle database logic.

Created Controllers to handle actions and workflow.

Updated Views to focus on presentation and data display.

Task 6: Finalize and test

Tested main workflows (catalog browsing, add/update/remove cart items).

Fixed issues found during testing and cleaned up code for submission.

Project Skills Learned

Designing and implementing relational databases (MySQL/phpMyAdmin)

PHP development with secure database access (PDO + prepared statements)

CRUD workflow implementation and form handling

Applying MVC architecture (Models, Views, Controllers)

Debugging and testing web application workflows

Using Git and GitHub for version control and submissions

Language Used

PHP (application logic)

HTML/CSS (UI structure and styling)

SQL / MySQL (MariaDB) (database design and queries)

Development Process Used

Iterative development: each week focused on a specific milestone (database → CRUD → MVC → final testing) with updates based on testing results and course requirements.

Notes (How to Run Locally)

Start your local server stack (example: MAMP).

Import the database SQL into phpMyAdmin (if required for your setup).
